/*
1 List of Algebra Modules for Secondo

This file contains a list of all currently available algebra modules.

The macros ~ALGEBRA\_INCLUDE~ and ~ALGEBRA\_EXCLUDE~ allow to include
or exclude an algebra to or from the set of loaded algebra modules.
These macros have three parameters:

  1 ~the unique identification number~ which must be a positive integer,
it is recommended but not absolutely necessary to order the entries of the
list in ascending order. No identification number may occur more than once
in the list.

  2 ~the algebra name~ which is used to build the name of the initialization
function: the algebra name is appended to the string "Initialize".

  3 ~the level of the algebra~ which may be one of the following: ~Descriptive~,
~Executable~ or ~Hybrid~.

  4 The active algebras are configured in the file makefile.algebras. A shell script
  extracts the identification number and the level by the Algebra name. Therfore no
  algebra initialization function name is allowed to appear twice, even if the line
  starts with a c++ comment
