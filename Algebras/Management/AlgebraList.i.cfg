1 List of Algebra Modules for Secondo

This file contains a list of all currently available algebra modules.

The macros ~ALGEBRA\_INCLUDE~ and ~ALGEBRA\_EXCLUDE~ allow to include
or exclude an algebra to or from the set of loaded algebra modules. They
are created by make (see 4.). Here you have just to define a unique name
and id for an algebra.

These macros have three parameters:

  1 ~the unique identification number~ which must be a positive integer,
it is recommended but not absolutely necessary to order the entries of the
list in ascending order. No identification number may occur more than once
in the list. The maximum id is bounded by a constant MAX\_ALG.

  2 ~the algebra name~ which is used to build the name of the initialization
function: the algebra name is appended to the string "Initialize".

  3 ~the level of the algebra~ which may be one of the following: ~Descriptive~,
~Executable~ or ~Hybrid~.

  4 The active algebras are configured in the file makefile.algebras. A shell script
  extracts the identification number and the level by the Algebra name. Therefore no
  algebra initialization function name is allowed to appear twice, even if the line
  starts with a c++ comment
