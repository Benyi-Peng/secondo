Installation hints for the ESSENTIA Library:

Homepage: http://essentia.upf.edu
Installation: http://essentia.upf/documentation/installing.html 

Current version, which is recommended to install is Essentia 2.1 beta3.

There is a really good online documentation of the library, including evrything
to install Essentia properly on differente operating systems.
You should read the steps (link documentation then scroll down to "Building an Installing Essentia").

Currently there is no deb package for Ubuntu, so you need to compile Essentia
from the source.

Summary for Ubuntu 14.10 or greater:

1. Installing dependencies
sudo apt-get install build-essential libyaml-dev libfftw3-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libavresample-dev libsamplerate0-dev libtag1-dev
2. Go to the directory you want to install Essentia
3. mkdir essentia
4. cd essentia
5. git clone https://github.com/MTG/essentia
6. cd essentia
7. ./waf configure --mode=release --with-cpptests --with-examples
8. ./waf
9. ./waf install					       # (as root)
10. echo "/usr/local/lib" > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/essentia.conf    # (as root)  
11. ldconfig -> dadurch wird Library systemweit bekannt        # (as root)



Summary for Ubuntu 14.04:


Ubuntu 14.04 shipps with an old and incompatible version of libav. You need to upgrade them first:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:heyarje/libav-11
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libavresample-dev libavutil-dev libavcodec-dev libav-tools

Now you can follow the installation steps above....


NOTE: Most included libraries are optional. For test purpose they are included here.


In the end you just have to add in includes and dependencies in the makefile.algebra file:

ALGEBRA_DIRS += MP3b
ALGEBRAS     += MP3Algebra
ALGEBRA_DEPS += essentia fftw3 yaml avcodec avformat avutil samplerate tag fftw3f
ALGEBRA_INCLUDE_DIRS += /usr/local/include/essentia
ALGEBRA_INCLUDE_DIRS += /usr/local/include/essentia/scheduler
ALGEBRA_INCLUDE_DIRS += /usr/local/include/essentia/streaming
ALGEBRA_DEP_DIRS += /usr/local/lib

Last hint: the MP3-Algebra depends on the MTree Algebra which depends on GeneralTreeAlgebra, XTreeAlgebra and SymbolicTrajectoryAlgebra. So these algebras have to be included.
ALGEBRA_DIRS  += GeneralTree
ALGEBRAS      += GeneralTreeAlgebra

ALGEBRA_DIRS  += XTree
ALGEBRAS      += XTreeAlgebra

ALGEBRA_DIRS  += SymbolicTrajectory
ALGEBRAS      += SymbolicTrajectoryAlgebra
