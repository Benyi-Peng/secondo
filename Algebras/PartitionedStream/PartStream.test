# A fresh restored opt database needs to be present for
# this test

#setup partstreamtest

open database opt;

# the conventions for commands are the same as in SecondoTTYBDB
# make sure that commands are always terminated 
# (either by a semicolon or by a newline)

# a TESTCASE consists of a TESTCASE declarative followed
# by a YIELDS declarative followed by a command.
# multiple or no commands after a YIELD directive
# will confuse the TestRunner

# the expected output specified by the YIELD declarative
# is converted to a ListExpr and the TestRunner compares
# it to Secondo's actual output by calling  
# NestedList->Equal
