# Queries the top 5 co-authors of publications of "Ralf Hartmut Gueting"
# The results will be grouped and show the Authors with the sum of
# joint publications.

# The last optional argument forces to choose the doc node as start point.
# This will take a lot longer than match2-coauthors as this verson uses an index
# to find a startnode.
