To use the MovingRegion2Algebra, the following needs to be done:



In the file makefile.optimizer the option -lgmpxx has to be added at line 67: -lgmpxx

LD_GMP := -lgmpxx -lgmp

Else the linking of the GMP library does not work for C++ support.




In order to make the examples work that are specified in the file MovingRegion2.examples, just put the file mr2createDB in the bin directory and run it within a secondo environment, e.g. type
@mr2createDB
within SecondoTTYBDB.
