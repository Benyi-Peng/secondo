  abstract  = {Due to the ubiquitous use of spatial data applications and the large amounts of spatial data that these applications generate, the processing of large-scale distance joins in distributed systems is becoming increasingly popular. Two of the most studied distance join queries are the K Closest Pair Query (KCPQ) and the varepsilon Distance Join Query (varepsilon DJQ). The KCPQ finds the K closest pairs of points from two datasets and the varepsilon DJQ finds all the possible pairs of points from two datasets, that are within a distance threshold varepsilon of each other. Distributed cluster-based computing systems can be classified in Hadoop-based and Spark-based systems. Based on this classification, in this paper, we compare two of the most current and leading distributed spatial data management systems, namely SpatialHadoop and LocationSpark, by evaluating the performance of existing and newly proposed parallel and distributed distance join query algorithms in different situations with big real-world datasets. As a general conclusion, while SpatialHadoop is more mature and robust system, LocationSpark is the winner with respect to the total execution time.},

A key feature of our parallel formulation (that distinguishes it from other proposed parallel formulations of multilevel algorithms) is that it partitions the vertices of the graph intopparts while distributing the overall adjacency matrix of the graph among allpprocessors. This mapping results in substantially smaller communication than one-dimensional distribution for graphs with relatively high degree, especially if the graph is randomly distributed among the processors. We also present a parallel algorithm for computing a minimal cover of a bipartite graph which is a key operation for obtaining a small vertex separator that is useful for computing the fill reducing ordering of sparse matrices. Our parallel algorithm achieves a speedup of up to 56 on 128 processors for moderate size problems, further reducing the already moderate serial run time of multilevel schemes. Furthermore, the quality of the produced partitions and orderings are comparable to those produced by the serial multilevel algorithm that has been shown to outperform both spectral partitioning and multiple minimum degree.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, there have been needs of accessing spatial data from distributed and preexisting spatial database systems interconnected through a network. In a distributed environment, spatial joins for two spatial relations residing at geographically separated sites are expensive in terms of computation and transmission cost because of the large size and complexity of spatial data. Previous distributed algorithm based on the spatial semijoin has accomplished performance improvements by eliminating objects before transmission to reduce both transmission and local processing costs. But with a widespread of a high bandwidth data transmission, the parallelism through data redistribution may improve the performance of spatial joins in spite of additional transmission costs. Hence, we propose a parallel spatial join processing for distributed spatial databases. We apply the task distribution method minimizing the data transmission and the solution for task distribution using a graph partitioning method. In experiments, we showed that the proposed method provides useful reductions in the cost of evaluating a join.},

This article proposes a partitioning algorithm that calculates a redistribution specified by the number of data items to be finally located on each process. This partitioning algorithm can also be used for data items with weights, which might express a computational load to be expected, and to produce a redistribution with an individual accumulated weight of data items specified for each process. Another important feature is that data sets with duplicated data keys can be handled. Parallel sorting with those properties is often needed for parallel scientific application codes, such as particle simulations, in which the dynamics of the simulated system may destroy locality and load balance required for an efficient computation. It is applied to random sample data and to a particle simulation code requiring a sorting. Performance results have been obtained on an IBM Blue Gene/P platform with up to 32768 cores. The results show that the proposed parallel sorting method performs well in comparison to other existing algorithms.},

  abstract = {With the current information explosion on the Web, numerous applications require access to a collection of different but related pieces of distributed geospatial data. In this paper, we focus on one set of such applications that requires efficient support of spatial operations (specifically, spatial join) on distributed non-database sources. The main challenge with this environment is that remote sources are usually read-only and/or do not support spatial queries. Moreover, several of these Web-based applications can tolerate either some level of inaccuracy or progressively filtered (or polished) results. Therefore, conventional distributed spatial join strategies are not applicable or efficient in this environment. To address these challenges, we first break down the process of distributed spatial join operation into three steps: (1) local to remote transfer, (2) remote spatial selection, and (3) local refinement. Then, for each step, we propose and study alternative techniques and by varying their combinations, we generate several query plans. Each plan strives to strike a compromise between efficiency and accuracy. Since the techniques proposed for the first step have significant impact on the overall performance of the query, we specially focus our attention on this step. We propose two heuristics for the first step to reduce either the number of selection queries or the area covered by each selection query. Within a realistic experimental set-up, we show that one heuristic is more appropriate with fast networks and a powerful local server, while the other one is superior in the opposite situation. Our experiments also show that both heuristics outperform approaches based on transmitting either the actual spatial objects or their bounding boxes. Note that the intention of this paper is not to propose a query optimizer to choose one plan over the others. Instead, it serves as a first step towards the design of such an optimizer by concentrating on the design and evaluation of several alternative plans within a realistic experimental set-up.},

  abstract = {The cost of spatial join processing can be very high because of the large sizes of spatial objects and the computation-intensive spatial operations. While parallel processing seems a natural solution to this problem, it is not clear how spatial data can be partitioned for this purpose. Various spatial data partitioning methods are examined in this paper. A framework combining the data-partitioning techniques used by most parallel join algorithms in relational databases and the filter-and-refine strategy for spatial operation processing is proposed for parallel spatial join processing. Object duplication caused by multi-assignment in spatial data partitioning can result in extra CPU cost as well as extra communication cost. We find that the key to overcome this problem is to preserve spatial locality in task decomposition. In this paper we show that a near-optimal speedup can be achieved for parallel spatial join processing using our new algorithms.},

  abstract    = {The focus of this thesis is on investigating efficient database algorithmsand methods for modern multi-core processors in main memory environments.We describe central features of modern processors in a historic perspectivebefore presenting a number of general design goals that should beconsidered when optimizing relational operators for multi-corearchitectures. Then, we introduce the skyline operator and relatedalgorithms, including two recent algorithms optimized for multi-coreprocessors. Furthermore, we develop a novel skyline algorithm using anangle-based partitioning scheme originally developed for parallel anddistributed database management systems. Finally, we perform a number ofexperiments in order to evaluate and compare current shared-memory skylinealgorithms.Our experiments reveals some interesting results. Despite of having anexpensive pre-processing step, the angle-based algorithm is able tooutperform current best-performers for multi-core skyline computation.In fact, we are able to outperform competing algorithms by a factor of5 or more for anti-correlated datasets with moderate to largecardinalities. Included algorithms exhibit similar performancecharacteristics for independent datasets, while the more basicalgorithms excel at processing correlated datasets. We observe similarperformance for two small real-life datasets. Whereas, the angle-basedalgorithm is more efficient for a work-intensive real-life datasetcontaining more than 2M 5-dimensional tuples.Based on our results we propose that database research targeted atshared-memory systems is focused not only on basic algorithms but alsomore sophisticated techniques proven effective for parallel anddistributed database management systems. Additionally, we emphasizethat modern processors have very fast inter-thread communicationmechanisms that can be exploited to achieve parallel speedup also forsynchronization-heavy algorithms.},

  abstract  = {DRP is a new concurrency control protocol for software transactional memory that achieves high throughput, even for skewed workloads that exhibit high contention. DRP builds on prior works that chop transactions into pieces to expose more concurrency opportunities, but unlike these works, DRP performs no static analyses and supports arbitrary workloads. DRP achieves a high degree of concurrency across most workloads and guarantees deadlock freedom, strict serializability, and opacity. We incorporate DRP into the software transactional objects library STO [18] and find that DRP improves STO’s throughput on several STAMP benchmarks by up to 3.6×. Additionally, an in-memory multicore database implemented with our modified variant of STO outperforms databases that use OCC or transaction chopping for concurrency control. Specifically, DRP achieves 6.6× higher throughput than OCC when contention is high. Compared to transaction chopping, DRP achieves 3.3× higher throughput when contention is medium or low. Furthermore, our implementation achieves comparable performance to OCC and transaction chopping at other contention levels.},

To facilitate high-speed solutions, we introduce a preprocessing step for complexity reduction of CIA problems, and include this approach within a new toolbox for solution of CIA problems with special focus on MPC. The proposed algorithm is implemented and utilized within an MPC simulation study for a solar thermal climate system with nonlinear system behavior and uncertain operation conditions. The results are analyzed in terms of solution quality, constraint satisfaction and runtime of the solution steps, showing the applicability of the proposed algorithm and implementations.},

Gradual patterns highlight complex order correlations of the form ``The more/less X, the more/less Y''. Only recently algorithms have appeared to mine efficiently gradual rules. However, due to the complexity of mining gradual rules, these algorithms cannot yet scale on huge real world datasets. In this paper, we thus propose to exploit parallelism in order to enhance the performances of the fastest existing one (GRITE) on multicore processors. Through a detailed experimental study, we show that our parallel algorithm scales very well with the number of cores available.},

Because of the sheer volume and complexity of spatial data, spatial joins between two spatial relations at different sites are expensive in terms of computational and transmission costs. In this paper, we address the problems of processing spatial joins in a distributed environment. We propose a semijoin-like operator, called the spatial semijoin, to prune away objects that do not contribute to the join result. This operator also reduces both the transmission and local processing costs for a later join operation. However, the cost of the elimination process must be taken into account, and we consider approaches to minimize these overheads. We also study and compare two families of distributed join algorithms that are based on the spatial semijoin operator. The first is based on multi-dimensional approximations obtained from an index such as the R-tree, and the second is based on single-dimensional approximations obtained from object mapping. We have conducted experiments on real data sets and report the results in this paper.},

  abstract = {Several studies have repeatedly demonstrated that both the performance and scalability of a shared-nothing parallel database system depend on the physical layout of data across the processing nodes of the system. Today, data is allocated in these systems using horizontal partitioning strategies. This approach has a number of drawbacks. If a query involves the partitioning attribute, then typically only a small number of the processing nodes can be used to speedup the execution of this query. On the other hand, if the predicate of a selection query includes an attribute other than the partitioning attribute, then the entire data space must be searched. Again, this results in waste of computing resources. In recent years, several multidimensional data declustering techniques have been proposed to address these problems. However, these schemes are too restrictive (e.g., FX, ECC, etc.), or optimized for a certain type of queries (e.g., DM, HCAM, etc.). In this paper, we introduce a new technique which is flexible, and performs well for general queries. We prove its optimality properties, and present experimental results showing that our scheme outperforms DM and HCAM by a significant margin.},

It could support more than two threads to execute simultaneously, and some executing units are owned by each core. We present hash join optimization based on shared cache CMP. Firstly, we propose multithreaded hash join execution framework based on Radix-Join algorithm, then we analyze the factors which affect performance of multithreaded Radix-Join algorithm in CMP. Basing on this analysis, we optimize the performance of various threads and their shared-cache access performance in the framework, and then theoretic analysis of speedup in multithreaded cluster partition phase is presents which could give some advices to cluster partition thread optimization. All of our algorithms are implemented in EaseDB. In the experiments, we evaluate performance of the multithreaded hash join execution framework, and the results show that our algorithm could effectively resolve cache access conflict and load imbalance in multithreaded environment. Hash join performance is improved.},

  abstract = {During the last decade, all commercial database systems have included features for parallel processing into their products. This development has been driven by the fact that databases grow in size at considerable rates. According to the results of the 1998 `very large database contest' the world’s largest databases, which have reached a size of over 10TB, double in size every year. At that speed, they outgrow the increase in processor speed and memory size, so additional measures are required to accommodate the effects of rapidly growing volumes of data. Parallelism is one of those options. It helps to keep processing times constant, even if the size of the database increases. That effect, which is often referred to as `scaleup' is important for loading, index creation, all kinds of administrative operations on the database, and of course for long batch-type applications. Parallelism is also employed to speed-up queries that otherwise would take days or weeks to process and thus would be useless for the application. This type of requirement: fast results of complex queries on large data sets is characteristic of decision support applications. In this overview we will explain how parallelism in databases can help to solve such problems.},

  abstract = {The development of database systems with hierarchical hardware architecture is currently a perspective trend in the field of parallel database machines. Hierarchical architectures have been suggested with the aim to combine advantages of shared-nothing architectures and architectures with shared memory and disks. A commonly accepted way of construction of hierarchical systems is to combine shared-memory (shared-everything) clusters in a unique system without shared resources. However, such architectures cannot ensure data accessibility under hardware failures on the processor cluster level, which limits their use in systems with high fault-tolerance requirements. In this paper, an alternative approach to construction of hierarchical systems is suggested. In accordance with this approach, the systems is constructed as an assembly of processor clusters with shared disks, with each cluster being a two-level multiprocessor structure with a standard strongly connected topology of interprocessor connections. A stream model for organization of parallel query processing in systems with the hierarchical architecture suggested is described. This model has been implemented in a prototype parallel database management system Omega designed for Russian multiprocessor computational systems MBC-100/1000. Our experiments show that the total performance of the processor clusters in the Omega system is comparable with that of the processor clusters with shared resources even in the case of great data skew. At the same time, the clusters of the Omega system are capable of ensuring a higher degree of data availability compared to the clusters with shared-memory architectures.},

  abstract  = {Sorting has tremendous usage in the applications that handle massive amount of data. Existing techniques accelerate sorting using multiprocessors or GPGPUs where a data set is partitioned into disjunctive subsets to allow multiple sorting threads working in parallel. Hardware sorters implemented in FPGAs have the potential of providing high-speed and low-energy solutions but the partition algorithms used in software systems are so data dependent that they cannot be easily adopted. The speed of most current sequential sorters still hangs around 1 number/cycle. Recently a new hardware merge sorter broke this speed limit by merging a large number of sorted sequences at a speed proportional to the number of sequences. This paper significantly improves its area and speed scalability by allowing stalls and variable sorting rate. A 32-port parallel merge-tree that merges 32 sequences is implemented in a Virtex-7 FPGA. It merges sequences at an average rate of 31.05 number/cycle and reduces the total sorting time by 160 times compared with traditional sequential sorters.},

As queries run continuously, the precious bandwidths would be aggressively consumed without careful optimization of operator ordering and placement. In this paper, we focus on the optimization of continuous multi-join queries over distributed streams. We observe that by partitioning streams into substreams we can significantly reduce the communication cost and hence propose a novel partition-based join scheme -- PMJoin. A few partitioning techniques are studied. To generate the query plan for each substream, a heuristic algorithm is proposed based on a rate-based model. Results from an extensive experimental study show that our techniques can sufficiently reduce the communication cost.},

In practice, however, they are known only approximately, with the error depending on the nature of the measurement and the source of data. In this paper, we address the problem how to perform spatial database operations in the presence of uncertainty. We first discuss a probabilistic spatial data model to represent the positional uncertainty. We then present a method for performing the probabilistic spatial join operations, which, given two uncertain data sets, find all pairs of polygons whose probability of overlap is larger than a given threshold. This method uses an R-tree based probabilistic index structure (PrR-tree) to support probabilistic filtering, and an efficient algorithm to compute the intersection probability between two uncertain polygons for the refinement step. Our experiments show that our method achieves higher accuracy than methods based on traditional spatial joins, while reducing overall cost by a factor of more than two.},

  abstract  = {Publisher Summary This chapter presents a generic technique called progressive merge join (PMJ) that eliminates the blocking behavior of sort-based join algorithms. The basic idea behind PMJ is to have the join produce results, as early as the external mergesort generates initial runs. Many state-of-the-art join techniques require the input relations to be almost fully sorted before the actual join processing starts. Thus, these techniques start producing first results only after a considerable time has passed. This blocking behavior is a serious problem when consequent operators have to stop processing in order to wait for first results of the join. Furthermore, this behavior is not acceptable if the result of the join is visualized or/and requires user interaction. These are typical scenarios for data mining applications. The off-time of existing techniques even increases with growing problem sizes.},

  abstract = {Companies providing cloud-scale data services have increasing needs to store and analyze massive data sets, such as search logs, click streams, and web graph data. For cost and performance reasons, processing is typically done on large clusters of tens of thousands of commodity machines. Such massive data analysis on large clusters presents new opportunities and challenges for developing a highly scalable and efficient distributed computation system that is easy to program and supports complex system optimization to maximize performance and reliability. In this paper, we describe a distributed computation system, Structured Computations Optimized for Parallel Execution (Scope), targeted for this type of massive data analysis. Scope combines benefits from both traditional parallel databases and MapReduce execution engines to allow easy programmability and deliver massive scalability and high performance through advanced optimization. Similar to parallel databases, the system has a SQL-like declarative scripting language with no explicit parallelism, while being amenable to efficient parallel execution on large clusters. An optimizer is responsible for converting scripts into efficient execution plans for the distributed computation engine. A physical execution plan consists of a directed acyclic graph of vertices. Execution of the plan is orchestrated by a job manager that schedules execution on available machines and provides fault tolerance and recovery, much like MapReduce systems. Scope is being used daily for a variety of data analysis and data mining applications over tens of thousands of machines at Microsoft, powering Bing, and other online services.},

Sorting in general covers internal and external sorting. Past published work has extensively focused on external sorting on uni-processors (serial external sorting), and internal sorting on multiprocessors (parallel internal sorting). External sorting on multiprocessors (parallel external sorting) has received surprisingly little attention; furthermore, the way current parallel database systems do sorting is far from optimal in many scenarios. The authors present a taxonomy for parallel sorting in parallel database systems, which covers five sorting methods: namely parallel merge-all sort, parallel binary-merge sort, parallel redistribution binary-merge sort, parallel redistribution merge-all sort, and parallel partitioned sort. The first two methods are previously proposed approaches to parallel external sorting which have been adopted as status quo of parallel database sorting, whereas the latter three methods which are based on redistribution and repartitioning are new, in that the have not been discussed in the literature of parallel external sorting.},

TOF is designed to achieve maximum throughput. Instead of resorting to complex indexes, TOF chooses to execute a batch queries at each run, so it can maximize data locality and parallelism on multi-core platforms. Using TOF, we designed algorithms for processing range queries and kNN queries respectively. Experimental study shows that these algorithms outperform the existing approaches significantly in terms of throughput.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, spatial applications have become more and more important in both scientific research and industry. Spatial query processing is the fundamental functioning component to support spatial applications. However, the state-of-the-art techniques of spatial query processing are facing significant challenges as the data expand and user accesses increase. In this paper we propose and implement a novel scheme (named VegaGiStore) to provide efficient spatial query processing over big spatial data and numerous concurrent user queries. Firstly, a geography-aware approach is proposed to organize spatial data in terms of geographic proximity, and this approach can achieve high aggregate I/O throughput. Secondly, in order to improve data retrieval efficiency, we design a two-tier distributed spatial index for efficient pruning of the search space. Thirdly, we propose an "indexing + MapReduce'' data processing architecture to improve the computation capability of spatial query. Performance evaluations of the real-deployed VegaGiStore system confirm its effectiveness.},

  abstract  = {The prevalence of multi-core processors has raised the question of whether applications can use the increasing number of cores efficiently in order to provide predictable quality of service (QoS). In this paper, we study the horizontal scalability of n-tier application performance within a multicore processor (MCP). Through extensive measurements of the RUBBoS benchmark, we found one major source of performance variations within MCP: the mapping of cores to virtual CPUs can significantly lower on-chip cache hit ratio, causing performance drops of up to 22% without obvious changes in resource utilization. After we eliminated these variations by fixing the MCP core mapping, we measured the impact of three mainstream hypervisors (the dominant Commercial Hypervisor, Xen, and KVM) on intra-MCP horizontal scalability. On a quad-core dual-processor (total 8 cores), we found some interesting similarities and dissimilarities among the hypervisors. An example of similarities is a non-monotonic scalability trend (throughput increasing up to 4 cores and then decreasing for more than 4 cores) when running a browse-only CPU-intensive workload. This problem can be traced to the management of last level cache of CPU packages. An example of dissimilarities among hypervisors is their handling of write operations in mixed read/write, I/O-intensive workloads. Specifically, the Commercial Hypervisor is able to provide more than twice the throughput compared to KVM. Our measurements show that both MCP cache architecture and the choice of hypervisors indeed have an impact on the efficiency and horizontal scalability achievable by applications. However, despite their differences, all three mainstream hypervisors have difficulties with the intra-MCP horizontal scalability beyond 4 cores for n-tier applications.},

This algorithm is suited for large data volumes (external sorting) and does not suffer from processing skew in presence of data skew. The core of the parallel sorting algorithm is a new adaptive partitioning method. The effect of data skew is remedied by taking samples representing the distribution of the input data. The parallel algorithm has been implemented on top of a shared disk multiprocessor architecture. The performance evaluation of the algorithm shows that it has linear speedup. Furthermore, the optimal degree of CPU parallelism is derived if I/O limitations are taken into account.},

Given a spatial distance threshold ∊ and an integer k, the top-k spatial distance join (k- SDJ) returns the k pairs of objects, which have the highest combined score (based on an aggregate function γ) among all object pairs in RS which have spatial distance at most ∊. Despite the practical application value of this query, it has not received adequate attention in the past. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing methods that utilize both location and score information from the objects, enabling top-k join computation by accessing a limited number of objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that a technique which accesses blocks of data from R and S ordered by the object scores and then joins them using an aR-tree based module performs best in practice and outperforms alternative solutions by a wide margin.},

This investigation has yielded a number of algorithms, including the symmetric hash join, the XJoin, the Ripple Join, and their variants.

In this paper, we propose a parallel non-blocking spatial join algorithm that uses duplicate avoidance rather than duplicate elimination. Results from a prototype implementation in a commercial parallel object-relational DBMS show that it generates answer tuples steadily even in the presence of memory overflow, and that its rate of producing answer tuples scales with the number of processors. Also, when allowed to run to completion, its performance is comparable with the state-of-the-art blocking parallel spatial join algorithm.},

The system employs Apache Cassandra as data storage and the extensible DBMS Secondo as a query processing engine. The resulting system is a distributed, general-purpose DBMS which is highly scalable and fault tolerant. The logical ring of Cassandra is used to split up input data into smaller units of work (UOWs), which can be processed independently. A decentralized algorithm is responsible to assign the UOWs to query processing nodes. In case of a node failure, UOWs are recalculated on a different node. All the data models (e.g. relational, spatial and spatio-temporal) and functions (e.g. filter, aggregates, joins and spatial-joins) implemented in Secondo can be used in a scalable way without changing the implementation. Many aspects of the distribution are hidden from the user. Existing sequential queries can be easily converted into parallel ones.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose parallel processing of continuous queries over data streams to handle the bottleneck of single processor DSMSs. Queries are executed in parallel over the logical machines in a multiprocessing environment. Scheduling parallel execution of operators is performed via finding the shortest path in a weighted graph called Query Mega Graph (QMG), which is a logical view of K machines. By lapse of time, number of tuples waiting in queues of different operators may be very different. When a queue becomes full, re-scheduling is done by updating weight of edges of QMG. In the new computed path, machines with more workload will be used less. The proposed system is formally presented and its correctness is proved. It is also modeled in PetriNets and its performance is evaluated and compared with serial query processing as well as the Min-Latency scheduling algorithm. The presented system is shown to outperform them w.r.t. tuple latency (response time), memory usage, throughput and also tuple loss- critical parameters in any data stream management systems.},

Based on a linear recursive program as a tool for formalism, a precise characterization for problems to be parallelized by the divide-and-conquer method is obtained. The performance of the parallel scheme is analyzed, and a necessary and sufficient condition to achieve linear speedup is obtained. The parallel scheme is generalized to include parameters, and a real application, the fuzzy join problem, is discussed in detail using the generalized scheme.},

  abstract = {With the popularity of parallel database machines based on the shared-nothing architecture, it has become important to find external sorting algorithms which lead to a load-balanced computation, i.e., balanced execution, communication and output. If during the course of the sorting algorithm each processor is equally loaded, parallelism is fully exploited. Similarly, balanced communication will not congest the network traffic. Since sorting can be used to support a number of other relational operations (joins, duplicate elimination, building indexes etc.) data skew produced by sorting can further lead to execution skew at later stages of these operations. In this paper we present a load-balanced parallel sorting algorithm for shared-nothing architectures. It is a multiple-input multiple-output algorithm with four stages, based on a generalization of Batcher's odd-even merge. At each stage then keys are evenly distributed among thep processors (i.e., there is no final sequential merge phase) and the distribution of keys between stages ensures against network congestion. There is no assumption made on the key distribution and the algorithm performs equally well in the presence of duplicate keys. Hence our approach always guarantees its performance, as long asn is greater thanp3, which is the case of interest for sorting large relations. In addition, processors can be added incrementally.},

The results show that using current, off-the-shelf technology coupled with a streamlined distributed operating system, three- and five-microprocessor configurations, provide a very cost-effective sort of large files. The three-processor configuration sorts a 100-Mb file in 1 hr which compares well to commercial sort packages available on high-performance mainframes. In additional experiments, the authors investigate a model to tune their sort software and scale their results to higher processor and network capabilities.<>},

We first study the scheduling problem of a set or a continuous sequence of independent tasks that are either from a bushy tree plan of a single query or from the plans of multiple queries, and present a clean and simple scheduling algorithm. Our scheduling algorithm achieves maximum resource utilizations by running an IO-bound task and a CPU-bound task in parallel with carefully calculated degrees of parallelism and maintains the maximum resource utilizations by dynamically adjusting the degrees of parallelism of the tasks whenever necessary. Real performance figures are shown to confirm the effectiveness of our scheduling algorithm. We then revisit the optimization problem of parallel execution plans of a single query and extend our previous results to also consider inter-operation parallelism by introducing a new cost estimation method to the query optimizer based on our scheduling algorithm. *This research was sponsored by the National Science Foundation under contract MIP 8715235.},

The skew in the distribution of join attribute values and the stochastic nature of the task processing times are identified as the major factors that can affect the effective exploitation of parallelism. Expressions for the execution time of parallel hash join and semijoin are derived and their effectiveness analyzed. When many small processors are used in the parallel architecture, the skew can result in some processors becoming sources of bottleneck while other processors are being underutilized. Even in the absence of skew, the variations in the processing times of the parallel tasks belonging to a query can lead to high task synchronization delay and impact the maximum speedup achievable through parallel execution. For example, when the task processing time on each processor is exponential with the same mean, the speedup is proportional to P/ln(P) where P is the number of processors. Other factors such as memory size, communication bandwidth, etc., can lead to even lower speedup. These are quantified using analytical models.<>},
