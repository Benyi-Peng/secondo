/*

Computes a balanced assignment of slots to workers.
The argument slotsizes contains the sizes of the all slots,
noWorkers is the number of workers on that the slots will
be distributed.

The result will contain for each slot the assigned worker
starting with zero. 

The algorithms works as follows.
First, the slots are sorted by their size.
Then, we iterator over the slots. The next slot is assigned to that
worker having the smallest load.
