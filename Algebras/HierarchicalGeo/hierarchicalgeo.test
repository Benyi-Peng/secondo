# a test for the spatial algebra
# run with : TestRunner -c SecondoConfig.ini < hierarchicalgeo.test

# A fresh restored berlin database needs to be present for
# this test


#setup hierarchicalgeotest

open database berlin



# The conventions for commands are the same as in SecondoTTYBDB
# make sure that commands are always terminated 
# (either by a semicolon or by a newline)

# a TESTCASE consists of a TESTCASE declarative followed
# by a YIELDS declarative followed by a command.
# multiple or no commands after a YIELD directive
# will confuse the TestRunner

# the expected output specified by the YIELD declarative
# is converted to a ListExpr and the TestRunner compares
# it to Secondo's actual output by calling  
# NestedList->Equal
