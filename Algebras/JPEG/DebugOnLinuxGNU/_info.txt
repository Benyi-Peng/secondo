these files are included and/or helpfull, IF debugging
using the switch in JPEGSourceMgr.h   and  GNU-debug
together with kdevelop.

'debugging' is called here examining the step-wise processing
of interesting or problematic input, such as to know why exactly
certain CMYK-jpegs are rejected (are there any?).

only files for analysing decompression by now.

for helping kdevelops class view (+= functions and structs- view)
be able to show these data structures and fn()s  (and for better
readability)  most 'template typedefs' ( I mean JMETHOD ... and the
like) had to be replaced by their instances for gcc on linux.

( class view is very helpful for fast access to determined
  code-part w/o knowing file and line no.   also for yielding
  overview: tree-view. and in C++: faster writing of methods ... )

The replacement of the 'template typedefs' applies *not only* to
jpeglib.h and jpegint.h, whose original versions are placed here
(for comparison, if needed).

but debugging should also work with the original files. (???)
