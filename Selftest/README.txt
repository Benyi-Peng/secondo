If results defined in the .examples file are to big they
can be stored as nested list in a file named by the following
convention:

result<No>_<Opname>_<Algebra>

where <Algebra> is the first part of the .example file. Hence
the short version (without suffix Algebra), e.g.

result1_feed_Relation
result3_PLUS_Standard

<No> is the number of the example,
<Opname> is the operator name or if it is a symbol like + the alias Name 
written in capital letters (like in the spec file).
