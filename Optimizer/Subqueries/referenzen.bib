  abstract = {Optimizing nested queries is an intricate problem. It becomes even
       harder if in a nested query the linking predicate or the
       correlation predicate occurs disjunctively. We present the
       first unnesting strategy that can effectively deal with such
       queries. The starting point of our approach is to translate SQL
       into the relational algebra extended by bypass operators. Then
       we present for the first time unnesting equivalences which are
       valid for algebraic expressions containing bypass operators.
       Applying these to the translated queries results in our
       effective unnesting strategy for nested SQL queries with
       disjunction. With an extensive experimental study (including
       three commercial DBMSs), we demonstrate the possible
       performance gains of our approach.},
