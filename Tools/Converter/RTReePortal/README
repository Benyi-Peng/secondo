This converter creates relations containing moving points together with 
an id. The source data come from:

http://www.rtreeportal.org/datasets.html

The data are gives as pure ascii text where each line is build as follow:

id,time,x,y,z

where all values are given as integer types. The meaning of the z-value is
undocumented, so this value is ignored by this converter. 
 
Unfortunately, the format of the time is not clear. In the converter is assumed
that one unit corresponds to 1 second. If it figures out, that this is not true, 
just change the constant value TimeUnit withing the RTreePortal2MPoint.java file.
You can also move the times by changing the DeltaTime constant within this file.

The tool is compiled by calling make within a bash. 
The converter itself is invoked by
java RTreePortal2MPoint <source> <ObjectName> [><target>]
Normaly, the converter write its output the the std-output. So it is easy it to write
into a file.
