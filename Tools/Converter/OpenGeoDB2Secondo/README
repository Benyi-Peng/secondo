This program converts the open-geo-database to a database ready for restoring
in SECONDO. The latest version of this database can be downloaded from:
    http://opengeodb.de/download/
Unfortunately the format of the data is changed since version 1.1.
The converter works with version 1.3 of this database. 
I hope it will works also with later versions. The version 1.3 contains
more than 17.000 locations of cities. The most of them are located in 
germany. 
For converting the database into SECONDO's nested list format you have to:
- download the txt-version of this database 
- recode the file for correction of umlauts
    recode ISO-8859-1 <filename>
- compile the Converter (just type in make)
- convert the database:
    java Converter <Name_of_the_database>   ><Outputfile>
  some errors are reported because some bugs in the data; ignore it
- copy <Outputfile> into SECONDO's bin directory
- start SECONDO
- create the database 'opengeodb'
- restore the database from <Outputfile>
