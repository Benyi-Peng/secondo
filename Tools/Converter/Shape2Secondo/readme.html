<H1>GeoTools 0.8.0</H1>
<H2>What is GeoTools?</H2>
<P>GeoTools is a Java library for manipulating and displaying geographic maps. Predominantly, it is used for displaying
interactive maps within web browsers without the need for any server-side support. However, the library can also
be used to develop client-server based solutions, applications and command line utilities. GeoTools is supported
by a wide and diverse developer and user community and it is continuing to grow in new directions.</P>
<P>
<H2>License</H2>
<P>The GeoTools library is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). In essence, this declares that
GeoTools is an open source library which can freely be used and modified in conjunction with any other code (open
or proprietary), provided the source for all modifications is made freely available. However, for the full legal
position and implications of the license, please refer to the full text which can be found in the <A HREF="license.txt">License</A>
file.</P>
<P>
<P>Thank you for downloading this release. We hope that this is the most stable relase of GeoTools to date, though inevitably there may still be problems.
Please report any problems, crashes, bugs, etc. using the <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=4091&atid=104091">'Submit

<P>The demonstrations package included in this release can be found in the Demonstrations folder. Please refer
to the <A HREF="demonstrations/readme.html">readme</A> file in that directory for more details and links to the
individual examples.
<H2>What's <B>not</B> in this release?</H2>
<P>The creation of this (0.8.0) release of GeoTools involved more the removal of code than the addition of anything
new. GeoTools has undergone continuous active development since its last official release over a year ago: much
of it, however, experimental. In order to provide a stable release, it was therefore decided to package together
all of the most important code, whilst excluding the newer, experimental code. Therefore, this release does not
include any of the following features:</P>
<P><BR>
Simple Feature SQL (SFSQL): Database communication standard, set out by Open GIS Consortium (OGC).</P>
<P>Geographical Markup Language (GML): The XML-based standard from the OGC for the exchange of geographic data.</P>
<P>MapInfo Interchange Format (MIF): File format used by MapInfo.</P>
<P>Web Map Server support (WMS): Easy connection to OGC-compliant web map servers.</P>
<P>Threaded loading: Improved multi-threaded loading system.</P>
<P>Data entry: Tools for creating and editing maps.</P>
<P>Demonstrations: Demonstrations which relied on any of the above features have been removed.</P>
<P><BR>
If you would like to help develop any of the above features, or are not afraid to work with experimental code,
then you can look at downloading the latest nightly builds from: <A HREF="http://www.geotools.org/dload.php">http://www.geotools.org/dload.php</A>.
We hope to have many, if not all, of the above features in a suitable state to include in the 0.9.x release of
GeoTools.</P>

<P></P>
<H2>Changes</H2>
