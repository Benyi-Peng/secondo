<H1>Getting Started as a Developer:</H1>
<H2>Prerequisites:</H2>
<P>This document is for users who want to fix, modify or extend the GeoTools library itself.&nbsp; Unlike the two
sister guides for end users and solution builders this document assumes a fair knowledge of Java.&nbsp; You should
have at least glanced through the other Getting Started guides and have managed to run, edit and recompile some
of the example applets from the Examples and Demos package. <BR>
&nbsp;
<H2>Things to get and do:</H2>
<P>If you are going to be working with the source code for GeoTools, then you want to be working with the most
up-to-date version possible.&nbsp; Until now, you will probably have been using the most recent release or dev
release of GeoTools.&nbsp; However, these can often be several months out of date whilst new features are developed
and tested.  To make sure that all developers have access to up-to-date code, we use a system known as CVS.&nbsp;
It is strongly recommended that you work out how to set up CVS on your machine, as this will allow you to track
changes in the code base as they happen.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com">http://cvsbook.red-bean.com</A> <BR>
<A HREF="http://www.cvshome.org">http://www.cvshome.org</A></P>

<P>Once you have it in place, then the following should provide you with an up-to-date version of the source code.</P>

<P><TT>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.geotools.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/geotools login&nbsp;</TT> <BR>
<TT>cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.geotools.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/geotools co geotools</TT></P>

<P>When it asks you for your password, just press enter.</P>

<P>Once you have done that, you can get updates by running</P>

<P><TT>cvs update</TT></P>

<P>from the geotools/src directory.</P>

<P>If you run into difficulty working out how to set up CVS, then feel free to submit a support request on the
GeoTools project site on SourceForge.&nbsp; Pick the 'using cvs' category and provide as much detail as you can
about the OS and platform you are running on.</P>

<P>Get and install a copy of ant.  It's a build tool which simplifies the process of building code (much like Make
does, only better).&nbsp;  For now, you can still get by without ant but, in the long run, having a copy will save
you a lot of time.<BR>
To get a copy, go to <BR>
<A HREF="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html">http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html</A></P>

<P>GeoTools also uses some support libraries, most notably the collections package from Sun and an XML tool kit
from IBM.  If you are happy just to use the binaries without their documentation, then they can be found in the
src/demonstrations/jars folder.</P>

<P>Finally, join both the <A HREF="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/geotools-discussion">geotools-discussion</A>
and the <A HREF="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/geotools-devel">geotools-devel</A> mailing lists.
 They are potentially your best resources for help and advice.
<H2>The file&nbsp; structure</H2>
<P>The checkout process should set up a directory structure as follows, don't worry about all the CVS folders that
have been created, these are important for cvs record keeping but you don't and indeed shouldn't have anything
to do with them. <BR>
&nbsp;

<UL>
	<LI>geotools
	<UL>
		<LI>src - root direcotry for all source code, also contains the build script for ant and a readme file
		<UL>
			<LI>cmp - top package of a utility library for reading little endiean files. (not expanded here)
			<LI>demonstrations - Contains the latest versions of all of the files found in the examples and demos package
			<UL>
				<LI>jars - Compiled versions of GeoTools and support libraries
				<LI>maps - Sample maps and related data used in the demonstrations.
			</UL>
			<LI>demos - Please ignore this directory, it should have been removed from CVS but it is being stubborn (not expanded
			here)
			<LI>uk - top package of the main GeoTools source tree, based on our main URL.&nbsp; We are in the UK
			<UL>
				<LI>&nbsp;ac - and we are at a university
				<UL>
					<LI>leeds&nbsp; - Leeds university in fact
					<UL>
						<LI>&nbsp;ccg - name of our research group, the centre for computational geography
						<UL>
							<LI>geotools - the main package for all things geotoolsy
							<UL>
								<LI>misc - a small collection of utility classes
								<LI>projections - experimental code for projection calculations
							</UL>
							<LI>shapefile - package dedicated to reading and writing .shp files
							<LI>dbffile - package dedicated to reading and writing .dbf files
							<LI>raster - support for rasters
							<LI>widgets - gui widegets that have been built for geotools
							<LI>gml - experimental GML reading code
							<LI>sfsql - experimental sql interface that pulls OGC simple fieatures from databases
							<LI>simplefeature - experimental representations of OGC simple feature geometries

<H2>Compiling GeoTools</H2>
<P>If all went well with the CVS&nbsp;check out and ant setup you should be able to go into the src directory and
type</P>
<P><TT>ant</TT></P>
<P>At which point ant should do all of the hard work and build a fresh copy of everything for you.</P>
<P><I>[This section needs more work, covering the output from ant, the new directories constructed and how to deal
with error messages that ant might throw]</I> <BR>
&nbsp;
<H2>Tracking changes</H2>
<P>Its all very well tracking changes, but how can you tell what has been added or modified each time you do a
cvs update? <BR>
One option is to use the cvs diff &lt;filename&gt; option to find out what exactly has changed, but perhaps more
useful the following site provides a regularly updated change history of who has been changing things and what
they have been doing. <BR>
<A HREF="http://geotools.sourceforge.net/cvs.php">http://geotools.sourceforge.net/cvs.php</A> <BR>
&nbsp;
<H2>Submitting bugs</H2>
<P>Probably one of the most important things you can do from day one is spot, document and report bugs.&nbsp; Even
if you have no clue how to fix them a good bug report is a vital tool in increasing the stability of GeoTools as
a whole.</P>
<P>Once you feel particularly confident with a particular part of GeoTools then you can even volunteer to have
bugs that others find assigned to you!
<H2>Submitting changes</H2>
<P>Initially you will only have anonymous access to cvs which means you can only read changes you can't submit
your own.&nbsp; However once you have fixed a few bugs or added a natty feature or two and you seem to know your
way around GeoTools then almost certainly one of the developers will offer you write access to the CVS repository
along with instructions on how to change your CVS settings.</P>
<P><I>[Add info here on using cvs to create patch files for trial submission until confident]</I> <BR>
&nbsp;
<H2>In depth discussion of the GeoTools architecture</H2>
<P>Now that you are all set up and digging into the innards of GeoTools this would be the ideal point to go over
some of the more complex design issues and reveal how most of the inner working actually work.&nbsp; Sadly that
is the job of a whole set of additional documentation that has yet to be written.&nbsp; With luck additional info
should not be long in arriving, feel free to send messages to the discussion list suggesting the areas you think
are in most urgent need of documentaiont.
<H2>Trouble shooting and getting help</H2>
<P>If something isn't working the way you think it should, don't spend too long banging your head against the problem.&nbsp;
There is a good chance you are dealing with a bug in geotools and nothing you do will make it go away.&nbsp; If
you suspect at all that it might be a bug then submit a bug report and it will be investigated.</P>
<P>For any further help at this level your best bet is to send a comment to the mailing list,&nbsp; their is a
good pool of talent and a good chance that someone is upagains the same problem.</P>
