<H1>Getting Started as an End User (version 1.0)</H1>
<H2>Prerequisites:</H2>
<P>This document assumes no knowledge of Java or, for that matter, any GIS skills. <BR>
You will, however, need at least some knowledge of HTML in order to put maps onto your web site. <BR>
You will also need some map data of your own, preferably in ESRI(tm) Shapefile format.&nbsp; (Though you can get
started with the data provided with the demos). <BR>
&nbsp;
<H2>Things to get:</H2>
<P>You should download the latest copy of the GeoTools examples and demos package. This comes in a file named demos.zip
which can be downloaded from the GeoTools <A HREF="http://geotools.org/dload.php">download site.</A></P>

<P>Don't worry about all of the other files that are available there, for the moment. You will only really need
them if you go on to become either a solution builder or a developer.</P>

<P>You should also have a web browser which fully supports Java 1.1, for example Netscape 4.06 or later, and Internet
Explorer 5 or later.&nbsp; (Make sure with both that, if you download it, you select the option to include Java,
as many recent releases default to not including it) <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp;
<H2>Trying the examples:</H2>
<P>Hopefully, you now have a copy of demos.zip and a Java-enabled web browser. So let's run quickly through getting
the demos running.</P>
<P>First, unpack the zip archive using your favourite archive tool.&nbsp; If you have no access to any tool on
your operating system for dealing with zip files, then submit a <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=4091">support
request </A>and we will look at getting the files to you in another format.</P>
<P>Once you have unpacked it, you should have a file called readme.html and a directory called 'demonstrations'.
<BR>
Open the readme.html file in your browser and click on 'view' under Example 1. This will open one of the pages
in the demonstrations folder which, after a short pause, should display a fairly plain map of the US.</P>
<P>If the map fails to appear, then take a look at the<A HREF="#trouble"> trouble shooting</A> section at the end
of this page.</P>
<P>Assuming that you have got a map on the screen, then try using the three buttons at the bottom of the map. Click
on the 'zoom' button and then drag a box out on a part of the map. The map will zoom in to the area you selected.&nbsp;
Click the 'pan' button and then click and hold the left mouse button over the map to drag the map around.&nbsp;
Finally, click the 'reset' button to return the view to one showing the whole of the US.</P>
<P>You can go back to the readme.html page and try some of the other examples if you want to see some more examples
of GeoTools in action. <BR>
&nbsp;
<H2>Exploring the files:</H2>
<P>OK, so how do the above demos work and what files are being used to get them working? <BR>
Each demo needs 5 files:

<UL>
	<LI>an html file - This holds the content of the web page and provides some information to the applet which will
	show the map.
	<LI>a class file - This controls the layout of the map and its controls.
	<UL>
		<LI>geotools.jar - The main archive which provides all of the mapping capabilities
		<LI>collections.jar - A support library written by Sun that GeoTools uses
		<LI>a zip file - This holds the map information used by the map applet
	</UL>
</UL>

<P>In the case of Example 1, the files that it needs are:</P>
<P>demonstrations\Example1.html <BR>
demonstrations\Example1.class <BR>
demonstrations\jars\geotools.jar <BR>
demonstrations\jars\collections.jar <BR>
demonstrations\maps\statepop.zip</P>
<P>Taking a look at each file in turn, the first is the web page itself.&nbsp; If you open it up in an editor you
will see that, for the main part, it is just like any other html page. The interesting part is the section marked
out in the applet tag:</P>
<P>&lt;APPLET ARCHIVE=&quot;jars/geotools.jar,jars/collections.jar&quot; CODE=&quot;Example1.class&quot;&nbsp;
WIDTH=&quot;430&quot; HEIGHT=&quot;270&quot; ALIGN=&quot;BOTTOM&quot;&gt; <BR>
&lt;PARAM NAME=&quot;shapefile&quot; VALUE=&quot;maps/statepop&quot;&gt; <BR>
&lt;/APPLET&gt;</P>
<P>Pulling this apart, we see that it first states that an applet is to be used.&nbsp; The<B> archive</B> tag provides
the location of the two support libraries - geotools.jar and collections.jar. <BR>
The <B>code</B> tag gives the name of the class file to use, whilst the <B>width</B>, <B>height</B> and <B>align</B>
tags say how big the applet should be.</P>
<P>Next there is one <B>param</B> tag. This is a parameter used by the applet. In this case, it is named '<B>shapefile'</B>
and takes the value of the location of the map file to use. Note that the '.zip' extension is not given.</P>
<P>Finally, the applet tag is closed and the rest of the page is just standard html.</P>
<P>The geotools.jar and collections.jar file are just library files and are required by every GeoTools applet.
There is nothing you need to change with these files.</P>
<P>If you open the statepop.zip file using an archive tool, you will see that it actually contains three files:
.shp, .shx and .dbf.&nbsp; GeoTools only needs the .shp and .dbf files but most shapefiles have all three and later
versions of GeoTools may make use of the .shx file (which is an index), so it's good to have it available. <BR>
&nbsp;
<H2>Putting your own map on the web</H2>
<P>Assuming that you have a shapefile of your own that you want to put onto a web site, how do you go about it?</P>
<P>Start with example 1, as this is the easiest to set up: <BR>
Make a copy of Example1.html called, for example, MyMap.html <BR>
Put your shapefile files into the maps directory (you can either put the three separate files there or archive
them into a single .zip file). <BR>
Change the <B>param</B> tag in MyMap.html so that the value is set to the name and location of your shapefile.</P>
<P>Open the html page in your browser and your map should appear.</P>
<P>GeoTools requires no server-side support so, provided all of the files needed are placed onto your web site,
the map should be available for all to see. <BR>
&nbsp;
<H2>Modifying the more advanced demos</H2>
<P>The next three demos, examples 2, 3 and 4, each introduce additional features to make the maps more interesting.
<BR>
Example 2 adds one more parameter which allows the map to show tooltips (these are small boxes which pop up to
provide information about the feature under the mouse cursor).</P>
<P>If you look at the applet tag for Example 2, you will see the following:</P>
<P>&lt;APPLET ARCHIVE=&quot;jars/geotools.jar,jars/collections.jar&quot; CODE=&quot;Example2.class&quot;&nbsp;
WIDTH=&quot;430&quot; HEIGHT=&quot;270&quot; ALIGN=&quot;BOTTOM&quot;&gt; <BR>
&lt;PARAM NAME=&quot;shapefile&quot; VALUE=&quot;maps/statepop&quot;&gt; <BR>
&lt;PARAM NAME=&quot;tooltip&quot; VALUE=&quot;STATE_NAME&quot;&gt; <BR>
&lt;/APPLET&gt;</P>
<P>The new parameter has the name <B>tooltip</B> and its value is set to the name of a column of data which can
be found in the .dbf file, in this case <B>STATE_NAME</B>. <BR>
If you know the names of any of the columns in your map's .dbf file, then try changing this parameter to show tooltips
on your map.&nbsp; Note that the applet tag now has <B>CODE</B> set to <B>Example2.class</B>. You cannot just add
a tooltip <B>param</B> tag to the Example1 html file, as that applet is not set up to display them.</P>
<P>Example 3 extends the concept in a similar way. This time, the name of a numeric column is given and GeoTools
uses this to shade the map in. In this case, the column <B>UNEMPLOY</B> is used which represents unemployment.</P>
<P>&lt;APPLET ARCHIVE=&quot;jars/geotools.jar,jars/collections.jar&quot; CODE=&quot;Example3.class&quot;&nbsp;
WIDTH=&quot;430&quot; HEIGHT=&quot;270&quot; ALIGN=&quot;BOTTOM&quot;&gt; <BR>
&lt;PARAM NAME=&quot;shapefile&quot; VALUE=&quot;maps/statepop&quot;&gt; <BR>
&lt;PARAM NAME=&quot;shadeby&quot; VALUE=&quot;UNEMPLOY&quot;&gt; <BR>
&lt;PARAM NAME=&quot;tooltip&quot; VALUE=&quot;STATE_NAME&quot;&gt; <BR>
&lt;/APPLET&gt;</P>
<P>One interesting feature of this applet is that, if you double click on the key, you will be shown a box which
allows you to change the way the shading is performed. <BR>
Again, if you know the name of a numeric column in your shapefile then you can edit the <B>param</B> tags so that
your map is shaded using that data.</P>
<P>Example 4 doesn't add any new parameters, but instead includes an additional control widget which makes it possible
to set zoom levels.</P>
<P>The final demo in the package, at the time of writing, is the GraphApplet demo which shows some of the more
interactive capabilities of GeoTools. Try taking a look at the <B>param</B> tags in that demo and see if you can
work out how to use your own data in the applet. <BR>
&nbsp;
<H2>Creating custom applets</H2>
<P>You may be happy with one of the applets provided as is in the demos package, in which case there is nothing
more for you to do, just place the files on a web site and publish your maps.&nbsp; But what if none of the applets
quite do what you are looking for?&nbsp; Perhaps you want to display more than one map layer in the viewer, or
perhaps you want some other form of interactivity, perhaps linking to a different kind of graph.&nbsp; If so, then
you have three options open to you: <BR>
First, go to the applet listings page at: <BR>
<A HREF="http://geotools.sourceforge.net/demos.php">http://geotools.sourceforge.net/demos.php</A> <BR>
Many of these can be configured using <B>param</B> tags and may do what you need.</P>
<P>If none of them are appropriate, then your second option is to get someone, possibly us, to put together a custom
applet that does what you need.&nbsp; If you represent a wealthy corporation with a budget burning a hole in your
pocket, then you can commision us to build a custom solution. If not, then one of us should be able to help you
out in our spare time.</P>
<P>Your final option is to take the plunge and learn some Java so that you can put custom solutions together yourself.
If you want to do that, then you will need to read the next 'getting started' introduction, for <A HREF="solutionBuilder.html">solution
builders.</A> <BR>
&nbsp;
<H2><A NAME="trouble"></A>Trouble shooting and getting help</H2>
<P>If none of the applets seem to be working for you at all, then submit a support request to the Geotools SourceForge
web site. Try to state what OS you are using and the version of the web browser you are using.&nbsp; If you know
how, then it would also be helpful if you can send a copy of any messages which appear in your browser's Java console.</P>
<P>To submit a support request, go the the projects development home page at: <BR>
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/geotools/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/geotools/</A></P>
<P>Pick the 'support' option from the list across the top of the page. On the next page, choose 'submit'. <BR>
You do not need to be a member on SourceForge to use this form. However, if you are then you will be able to use
the SourceForge site to track your request more closely.</P>
<P>Pick 'Getting Started' from the category list and then provide a summary and any other details you can think
of.</P>
<P>If you can get some of the applets to work but are having problems with some aspects of them, or with setting
things up the way you want them, then you have two options. The first is to use the support request form as above,
but giving details of what your problem is. The second is to look at the geotools-discussion archive to see if
your problem has come up before. If not, then feel free to join the list and post your query for all to pick over.</P>
