===============================================================================

The release deployed at March 14 runs into compiler errors. As work around you
need to delete two files, please execute the commands below: 

  cd Javagui/tools
  rm *Disturber*

If you plan to set up an SDK using "openSuSe 10.2" you can use the system's gcc
(e.g. installsdk -s) which reports the version 

  gcc (GCC) 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (SUSE Linux).

Please refer to the Installation-Guide for detailed explanations.

New features:
-------------

 * Many bug fixes of operators in various algebra modules.

 * Provision of a test database called "berlintest".

 * The example queries for operators are now working on database berlintest.
   They are collected in a system table called SEC2OPERATORINFO. This may
   help you to find "running" examples and to learn more quickly about the
   capabilities of the implemented algebra modules.  

 * Implementation of a quick regression test called "Selftest". It runs all 
   examples on berlintest and compares them with result sets. We decided to
   put the database and the results into the source tree. This blowed up the
   archive's size but gives all users the chance to test whether their own
   implementations make the system instable or not.
