# --- Secondo Configuration ---
#
# This is an example file. copy or rename it to SecondoConfig.ini
#
# Note: every parameter explained below can be overruled by an environment
# variable with name SECONDO_PARAM_<keyname>, 
# e.g.: export SECONDO_PARAM_SecondoHome="/tmp/databases"

[Environment]
# Home directory of Secondo database, in fact the place where the Berkeley DB will
# store all record files used by Secondo. Note: By default, the directory /home/secondo-databases
# is used for the Berkeley DB files. A directory different from this will be used iff it is 
# specified below AND it exists!
# Note: On windows you need absolute path names, e.g.
# C:\msys\1.0\home\user\secondo-dbtest 
SecondoHome=/home/databases1

# Algebralevel after startup (Executable|Descriptive|Hybrid). 
AlgebraLevel=Executable

# Name of the local socket of the Secondo registrar
RegistrarName=SECONDO_REGISTRAR

# Name of the executable of the Secondo registrar program

# Name of the executable of the Secondo listener program

# Host address of the Secondo server

# Runtime Flags (refer to class RTFlags). This key can be used to define 
# a comma separated list of runtime flags which switch on some special messages 
# (for debugging or profiling) or some features like creating binary 
# list formats for CS-communication. Please document new flags otherwise
# this mechanism is not useful. Note: a += assignment will extend the list.
# It is also possible to change flags interactively by typing
#
# (set "<KeyName>" = TRUE | FALSE)
#
# at the SECONDO command prompt.

### SECONDO INTERFACE

# Print the counter values of Class Counter (refer Counter.h) after every query
# command
#RTFlags = SI:PrintCounters


# Supress to measure cpu-time,real-time, and nested list 
# memory used for processing a query.
#RTFlags += SI:NoQueryAnalysis 

# Suppress the output of the command in NL format before execution
#RTFlags += SI:NoCommandEcho 

# Various statistical information about tuples and relations.
#RTFlags += SI:RelStatistics 

# Print out nested list of the result before copying it into 
# the applications list memory.
#RTFlags += SI:ResultList

# Measure the time for copying lists between NL-instances.
#RTFlags += SI:CopyListTime

# Show the used times for every Secondo Command
#RTFlags += SI:CommandTime

###
### CLIENT / SERVER
###

# This flag controls if binary encoded or textual lists are transferred.
RTFlags +=  Server:BinaryTransfer

# If set, a result.bnl file is created on the server side.
#RTFlags += Server:ResultFile

# Measure the time for writing the result list to the socket object. 
#RTFlags += Server:SendTimeMsg


###
### SMI 
###

# Switch off the transaction and logging subsystem of Berkeley-DB
#RTFlags += SMI:NoTransactions

#RTFlags += SMI:DbHandles

# Show how often the requested buffersize could not be 
# transferred and the number of sleep calls; 
#RTFlags += Socket:SendStat

###
### ALGEBRA SPECIFIC SWITCHES
###

# Print out messages in methods of the FTextAlgebra. 
#RTFlags += FText:Trace

# Print extra output in the ExtRelationAlgebra
#RTFLAGS += ERA:TraceMergeJoin
#RTFLAGS += ERA:ShowMemInfo
#RTFLAGS += ERA:Sort:PartitionInfo

# Extra output for the RelationAlgebra
#RTFLAGS += RA:TupleBufferInfo
#RTFLAGS += RA:ShowMemInfo

# Extra output for the ArrayAlgebra

# --- Context sections ---
#
# To allow fine tuning of the storage management it is possible to
# define several "context" sections which can be referenced when
# creating or opening SmiFiles. The "Default" context section lists
# all possible parameters.
