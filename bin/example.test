# An example test spec for the Secondo TestRunner
# run with : TestRunner -i example.test
#
# (TestRunner can be found in directory UserInterfaces)

# A test specification consists of initial commands, a section of commands
# setting up the test, a sequence of test cases, and a section of commands
# cleaning up. The TestRunner uses directives to specify these sections.
# directives are specified in comment lines, all comment lines beginning with a
# directive are interpreted as commands to the TestRunner, non-comment lines are
# passed to Secondo. The possible directives are SETUP, TESTCASE, YIELDS and
# TEARDOWN (here i have written the directives in upper case to avoid confusion,
# the real directives must be written in lower case). The meanings of those
# directives are explained the following commented examples.


# before the SETUP directive one can place Secondo commands
# which may or may not suceed
delete database mytestdb;

# the SETUP directive may specify the name of the test
# the SETUP directive must appear exactly once in a test spec

#setup exampletest

# if a command between the SETUP directive and the first
# TESTCASE directive fails, then the whole test has failed 
# and we immediately skip to the teardown
# (the whole test does not make sense anymore if the 
# SETUP has failed)

create database mytestdb;
open database mytestdb;

# the conventions for commands are the same as in SecondoTTYBDB

# make sure that commands are always terminated 
# (either by a semicolon or by a newline)

# For floating point values it may be sufficient if the result
# is aprroximately correct. Therefore a tolerance can be specified
# either as relative or as absolute abberration. The tolerance will
# be defined until it is reset by ~tolerance_real 0.0~ 


# First we compute 10 / 3.14 ~ 3.1847133758
# we allow a deviation in the 4th value behind the period
# by setting
#
# tolerance_real 0.0009
#
# hence the following test will be correct

#testcase FloatingPoint1
# yields (real 3.184)
query 10 / 3.14 


# An unspecified yields definition will result in an error
# for example

#testcase FloatingPoint4
