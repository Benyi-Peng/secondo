Installation
------------

* Prerequisite: The Berkeley-DB 4.0.14 must be installed with C++ support

* Unzip the Secondo archive into a directory of your choice
  then change to this directory

* Select the appropriate platform in 'makefile.config'

* Adjust the path information in the platform dependent makefile
  - 'makefile.win32' for Windows
  - 'makefile.linux' for Linux
  - 'makefile.solaris' for Sun/Solaris

* Run 'make' and/or 'make shared=yes'
  - libraries are created and copied to the 'lib' directory

* Run 'make tests' and/or 'make tests shared=yes'
  - test programs are created and copied to the 'bin' directory

* Before running the tests:
  - make the libraries accessible by defining
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Unix-like systems:
    - export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<Secondo>/lib:<BerkeleyDB>/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
      where <Secondo> is the Secondo home directory and
            <BerkeleyDB> is the Berkeley DB home directory
  - create a directory for the Secondo database files and change
    'SecondoConfig.ini' appropriately.
